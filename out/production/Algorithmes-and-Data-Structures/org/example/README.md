# Algorithms and Data Structures

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains implementations of fundamental algorithms and data structures in Java. The code is organized by topic to make it easier to learn and understand each concept.

## 📁 Directory Structure

- **mathAlgorithmes/**  
  Contains implementations of mathematical algorithms such as:
  - Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
  - Least Common Multiple (LCM)
  - Sieve of Eratosthenes
  - Euclidean Algorithm

- **sortingAlgorithmes/**  
  Contains implementations of sorting algorithms such as:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort

  Additionally includes:
  - **SortingComparator** – a utility class to compare the performance of different sorting algorithms.
  - **SortingUtils** – a helper class with utility functions for sorting, e.g., generating random arrays, timing methods, etc.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any IDE that supports Java (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

## 🚀 How to Run
